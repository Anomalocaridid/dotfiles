# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for NixOS

# Usage:
Run the following command from a NixOS installation medium:

## NOTE: Change branch before merge

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anomalocaridid/dotfiles/scripts/nixos-install.sh | sudo bash
  
```
I highly recommend that you read `scripts/nixos-install.sh` BEFORE running it so that you know what it will do in advance.
